-- In-game tests for the shared entity placement restriction module. These run under _DEBUG
-- via /test-runner on any map that loads the module (danger ores, concrete jungle, dino
-- island, rail grid, the crash site presets).
--
-- The tests drive the banned and allowed lists rather than a keep_alive_callback, because
-- the callback is a single global slot owned by whichever map is loaded and there is no way
-- to read it back and restore it. Banned entities are destroyed before the callback is ever
-- consulted, and allowed entities return before it too, so these tests behave the same on
-- every map.
